# Sudoku Solver

A Python program that solves a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a popular constraint-solving technique to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently.
## Description

This project provides a solution to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm. Given a partially filled Sudoku grid, the program finds the solution by recursively trying possible values for each empty cell while respecting Sudoku's constraints.

### Backtracking Algorithm

The backtracking algorithm is used to explore possible number placements for the empty cells of the puzzle. If a valid number is found, it is placed in the grid. The algorithm then moves to the next empty cell. If no valid number can be placed, it backtracks and tries a different value for the previous cell.
